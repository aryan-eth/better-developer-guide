## Interfaces explained

In object-oriented programming (OOP), an interface is a set of rules or contracts that define the expected behavior of a class or object. An interface specifies the signature of a set of methods, properties, or events, without providing an implementation for those members.

Interfaces allow for better code organization and abstraction, and enable polymorphism by allowing different classes to implement the same interface and be used interchangeably.

Here is an example of how to use interfaces in a JavaScript OOP codebase:

```jsx
// define an interface named "IVehicle"
interface IVehicle {
  // specify the signature of a method named "start"
  start(): void;
  // specify the signature of a property named "speed"
  speed: number;
}

// define a class named "Car" that implements the "IVehicle" interface
class Car implements IVehicle {
  // implement the "start" method
  start(): void {
    // logic to start the car
  }

  // implement the "speed" property
  speed: number;
}

// create an instance of the "Car" class
const car = new Car();

// call the "start" method on the car instance
car.start();

// set the "speed" property on the car instance
car.speed = 100;
```

In this example, the **`IVehicle`** interface defines the signature of the **`start`** method and the **`speed`** property. The **`Car`** class implements the **`IVehicle`** interface, providing an implementation for the **`start`** method and the **`speed`** property.

The **`Car`** class can be treated as an instance of the **`IVehicle`** interface, and can be used interchangeably with other classes that implement the same interface. This allows for flexibility and modularity in the code, and ensures that the classes that implement the interface adhere to the specified rules and contracts.

### Interfaces in React

In a React application, interfaces can be used to define the expected shape of the data that is passed to components as props. This allows for better type checking and type safety in the code, and helps to prevent unintended errors or bugs.

Here is an example of how to use an interface to define the expected shape of the props in a React component:

```jsx
// define an interface named "IUser"
interface IUser {
  // specify the shape of the "name" property
  name: string;
  // specify the shape of the "age" property
  age: number;
}

// define a functional component named "UserCard"
function UserCard(props: IUser) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Name: {props.name}</p>
      <p>Age: {props.age}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// create an object that matches the shape of the "IUser" interface
const user = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
};

// render the "UserCard" component with the "user" object as props
<UserCard {...user} />
```

In this example, the **`IUser`** interface defines the shape of the **`name`** and **`age`** properties that are expected to be passed to the **`UserCard`** component as props. The **`UserCard`** component is defined with the **`props`** parameter typed as the **`IUser`** interface, which ensures that the **`props`** object has the expected shape.

The **`UserCard`** component is then rendered with the **`user`** object as props, which matches the shape of the **`IUser`** interface. This ensures that the component receives the correct data and can render it correctly. Using an interface in this way helps to prevent unintended errors or bugs, and improves the type safety and maintainability of the code.

## Abstract class vs Interfaces

In object-oriented programming (OOP), an abstract class and an interface are two different language constructs that provide similar functionality. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated, and must be extended by a derived class that provides an implementation for the abstract members. An interface is a collection of abstract members that define a contract or set of rules that a class must implement.

While both abstract classes and interfaces allow for abstraction and polymorphism in the code, they have some differences in their usage and capabilities.

Here is an example that illustrates the differences between an abstract class and an interface in a JavaScript OOP codebase:

```jsx
// define an abstract class named "Shape"
abstract class Shape {
  // define an abstract method named "area"
  abstract area(): number;
}

// define a class named "Circle" that extends the "Shape" abstract class
class Circle extends Shape {
  // implement the "area" method
  area(): number {
    // logic to calculate the area of a circle
  }
}

// define an interface named "IVehicle"
interface IVehicle {
  // specify the signature of a method named "start"
  start(): void;
  // specify the signature of a property named "speed"
  speed: number;
}

// define a class named "Car" that implements the "IVehicle" interface
class Car implements IVehicle {
  // implement the "start" method
  start(): void {
    // logic to start the car
  }

  // implement the "speed" property
  speed: number;
}

// create an instance of the "Circle" class
const circle = new Circle();

// call the "area" method on the circle instance
circle.area();

// create an instance of the "Car" class
const car = new Car();

// call the "start" method on the car instance
car.start();

// set the "speed" property on the car instance
car.speed = 100;
```

In this example, the **`Shape`** abstract class defines an abstract method named **`area`**. The **`Circle`** class extends the **`Shape`** class and provides an implementation for the **`area`** method. The **`Circle`** class can be instantiated, and the **`area`** method can be called on the instance.

The **`IVehicle`** interface defines the signature of the **`start`** method and the **`speed`** property. The **`Car`** class implements the **`IVehicle`** interface, providing an implementation for the **`start`** method and the **`speed`** property. The **`Car`** class can be instantiated, and the **`start`** method and **`speed`** property can be used on the instance.

In summary, an abstract class allows for abstraction and polymorphism by providing a base class that cannot be instantiated, but must be extended by a derived class that provides an implementation for the abstract members. An interface allows for abstraction and polymorphism by defining a contract or set of rules that a class must implement.

## MVP architecture

The MVP (Model-View-Presenter) architecture is a design pattern that is commonly used in software development. It is an adaptation of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, which separates the application into three main components: the model, the view, and the controller.

In the MVP architecture, the controller is replaced by the presenter, which is responsible for managing the interactions between the model and the view. The model represents the data and the business logic of the application, the view represents the user interface, and the presenter acts as a mediator between the model and the view.

Here is an example of how to use the MVP architecture in a JavaScript application:

```jsx
// define a class named "UserModel" that represents the model
class UserModel {
  // define a property named "name"
  name: string;

  // define a method named "setName" that updates the "name" property
  setName(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

// define a class named "UserView" that represents the view
class UserView {
  // define a property named "userModel"
  userModel: UserModel;

  // define a method named "render" that updates the user interface
  render() {
    // logic to update the user interface with the "name" property of the model
  }
}

// define a class named "UserPresenter" that represents the presenter
class UserPresenter {
  // define a property named "userModel"
  userModel: UserModel;

  // define a property named "userView"
  userView: UserView;

  // define a method named "setName" that updates the model and the view
  setName(name: string) {
    // update the "name" property of the model
    this.userModel.setName(name);

    // update the user interface with the new "name" property
    this.userView.render();
  }
}

// create an instance of the "UserModel" class
const userModel = new UserModel();

// create an instance of the "UserView" class
const userView = new UserView();

// create an instance of the "UserPresenter" class
const userPresenter = new UserPresenter();

// set the "userModel" and "userView" properties of the presenter
userPresenter.userModel = userModel;
userPresenter.userView = userView;

// call the "setName" method on the presenter
userPresenter.setName('John Doe');
```

In this example, the **`UserModel`** class represents the model and contains the data and the business logic of the application. The **`UserView`** class represents the view and is responsible for rendering the user interface. The **`UserPresenter`** class represents the presenter and acts as a mediator between the model and the view.

The **`UserPresenter`** class updates the **`UserModel`** with the new **`name`** property, and then updates the **`UserView`** with the new **`name`** property. This allows the model and the view to be decoupled and independent of each other, and allows the presenter to manage the interactions between them.

In summary, the MVP architecture allows for better separation of concerns and modularity in the code, and makes it easier to maintain and extend the application. It also allows for better testability and flexibility, as the components can be tested and swapped out independently

## MVC introduction

The model-view-controller (MVC) is a design pattern that is often used in software development. The pattern is used to separate the application into three main components: the model, the view, and the controller.

The model is the central component of the pattern, and it is responsible for managing the data of the application. This might include things like database interactions, business logic, and other functions that are related to the data.

The view is the user interface of the application, and it is responsible for displaying the data to the user and providing a way for the user to interact with the application. In an MVC application, the view is typically created based on the data in the model.

The controller is the component that receives user input and, based on that input, determines what should be done with the data. This might include things like calling functions in the model to update the data, or telling the view to display a certain piece of information.

Here is an example of how the MVC pattern might be used in a simple to-do list application:

- The model would manage the data for the to-do list, including the tasks that have been added, their due dates, and their completion status.
- The view would display the to-do list to the user, allowing them to add, edit, and complete tasks.
- The controller would receive input from the user, such as when they add a new task or mark a task as complete, and it would update the model accordingly.

In this way, the MVC pattern helps to separate the different aspects of the application and make it easier to develop and maintain.

There are many advantages to using the MVC pattern in software development. Some of the main benefits include the following:

1. Modularity: The MVC pattern helps to modularize the application into distinct components, which can make the code easier to understand, maintain, and update.
2. Reusability: Because the components of an MVC application are separate and independent, they can be reused in other applications or even in other parts of the same application.
3. Separation of concerns: The MVC pattern ensures that each component of the application has a well-defined responsibility, which can make it easier to manage and understand the code.
4. Maintainability: Because the components of an MVC application are loosely coupled, it is easier to make changes to one component without affecting the others. This can make the application more maintainable over time.
5. Testability: The MVC pattern makes it easier to test the different components of the application independently, which can help to ensure that the application is of high quality and free of bugs.

Overall, the MVC pattern is a powerful and widely used design pattern that can help to improve the structure, maintainability, and overall quality of software applications.

### Python example

```python
# The Model class manages the data of the application
class Model:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = []
        self.completed_tasks = []

    def add_task(self, task):
        self.tasks.append(task)

    def complete_task(self, task):
        self.completed_tasks.append(task)
        self.tasks.remove(task)

# The View class displays the data to the user and provides
# a way for them to interact with the application
class View:
    def display_tasks(self, tasks):
        print("Tasks:")
        for task in tasks:
            print("- ", task)

    def display_completed_tasks(self, tasks):
        print("Completed tasks:")
        for task in tasks:
            print("- ", task)

    def get_user_input(self):
        return input("Enter a task: ")

# The Controller class receives user input and determines
# what should be done with the data
class Controller:
    def __init__(self, model, view):
        self.model = model
        self.view = view

    def run(self):
        while True:
            user_input = self.view.get_user_input()
            if user_input == "q":
                break
            elif user_input == "c":
                self.model.complete_task(self.model.tasks[0])
            else:
                self.model.add_task(user_input)

            self.view.display_tasks(self.model.tasks)
            self.view.display_completed_tasks(self.model.completed_tasks)

# Create the Model, View, and Controller objects
model = Model()
view = View()
controller = Controller(model, view)

# Run the application
controller.run()
```

In this example, the **`Model`** class manages the data of the application, the **`View`** class displays the data to the user and provides a way for them to interact with the application, and the **`Controller`** class receives user input and determines what should be done with the data. These three components work together to create a simple to-do list application that allows the user to add tasks and mark them as complete.

### React example

Here is a simple example of an MVC application written in React:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

// The Model manages the data of the application
const Model = {
  tasks: [],
  completedTasks: [],
  addTask(task) {
    this.tasks.push(task);
  },
  completeTask(task) {
    this.completedTasks.push(task);
    this.tasks = this.tasks.filter(t => t !== task);
  },
};

// The View displays the data to the user and provides
// a way for them to interact with the application
const View = ({ tasks, completedTasks, addTask, completeTask }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>Tasks</h1>
    <ul>
      {tasks.map(task => (
        <li key={task}>
          {task}
          <button onClick={() => completeTask(task)}>Complete</button>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
    <h1>Completed Tasks</h1>
    <ul>
      {completedTasks.map(task => (
        <li key={task}>{task}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
    <input
      type="text"
      placeholder="Enter a task"
      onKeyDown={(e) => {
        if (e.key === "Enter") {
          addTask(e.target.value);
          e.target.value = "";
        }
      }}
    />
  </div>
);

// The Controller receives user input and determines
// what should be done with the data
const Controller = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useState({
    tasks: Model.tasks,
    completedTasks: Model.completedTasks,
  });

  const addTask = (task) => {
    Model.addTask(task);
    setState({
      tasks: Model.tasks,
      completedTasks: Model.completedTasks,
    });
  };

  const completeTask = (task) => {
    Model.completeTask(task);
    setState({
      tasks: Model.tasks,
      completedTasks: Model.completedTasks,
    });
  };

  return <View tasks={state.tasks} completedTasks={state.completedTasks} addTask={addTask} completeTask={completeTask} />;
};

// Render the Controller
ReactDOM.render(<Controller />, document.getElementById("root"));

```

In this example, the **`Model`** object manages the data of the application, the **`View`** component displays the data to the user and provides a way for them to interact with the application, and the **`Controller`** component receives user input and determines what should be done with the data. These three components work together to create a simple to-do list application that allows the user to add tasks and mark them as complete.

## Dependency injection

### Introduction

Dependency injection is a software design pattern that is used to implement inversion of control (IOC) in a program. Inversion of control is a programming principle that states that the flow of control in a program should be inverted compared to traditional control flow. In other words, rather than a program calling the functions it needs, the functions are passed to the program and called by the program.

Dependency injection is a way of implementing inversion of control in a program. In dependency injection, the objects that a program depends on are passed to the program as dependencies, rather than the program creating them itself. This allows the program to be more flexible and easier to test, because the dependencies can be easily mocked or replaced with different implementations.

Here is an example of dependency injection in Python:

```python
Copy code
class Service:
    def do_something(self):
        print("Doing something")

# The Program class uses the Service class
class Program:
    def __init__(self, service):
        # The service is passed to the program as a dependency
        self.service = service

    def run(self):
        # The program uses the service to do something
        self.service.do_something()

# Create a Service object
service = Service()

# Create a Program object and pass the Service object as a dependency
program = Program(service)

# Run the program
program.run()
```

In this example, the **`Program`** class depends on the **`Service`** class to do something. Instead of creating a **`Service`** object itself, the **`Program`** class receives a **`Service`** object as a dependency when it is created. This allows the **`Program`** class to be more flexible and easier to test, because the **`Service`** object can be easily mocked or replaced with a different implementation.

### Advantages

There are many advantages to using dependency injection in software development. Some of the main benefits include the following:

1. Loose coupling: Dependency injection helps to decouple the objects in a program, which can make the code more modular and easier to maintain.
2. Reusability: Because the dependencies of a program are passed to the program, rather than being created within the program, the same dependencies can be used in multiple programs, which can improve code reuse.
3. Testability: Dependency injection makes it easier to test the objects in a program, because the dependencies can be easily mocked or replaced with test doubles. This can help to ensure that the program is of high quality and free of bugs.
4. Flexibility: Dependency injection allows the dependencies of a program to be easily changed, which can make the program more flexible and adaptable.

Overall, dependency injection is a powerful software design pattern that can help to improve the structure, maintainability, and overall quality of a program.

## Designing classes

There are several things that you can do to become better at designing classes in software development. Some tips for designing effective classes include the following:

1. Keep your classes small and focused: Classes should have a single, well-defined responsibility, and they should not try to do too much. This will make your classes easier to understand, maintain, and test.
2. Avoid tight coupling: Try to design your classes in a way that minimizes their dependencies on other classes. This will make your classes more modular and easier to reuse in other parts of the application.
3. Use composition over inheritance: Composition is a design pattern that allows you to create new classes by combining other classes, rather than by inheriting from them. This can help to avoid the problems associated with inheritance, such as tight coupling and complex class hierarchies.
4. Be consistent: Use consistent naming conventions and design patterns throughout your application. This will make your code easier to understand and maintain.
5. Write tests: Writing tests for your classes can help to ensure that they are working correctly and that they are reliable and maintainable over time.

By following these tips, you can improve the design of your classes and create more effective and maintainable software.

### Examples

Here are some examples of small and focused class designs for simple tasks:

- A **`Calculator`** class that performs basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This class could have methods like **`add()`**, **`subtract()`**, **`multiply()`**, and **`divide()`**, and it could use composition to combine other classes that perform more specific operations, such as square root or logarithm.
- A **`Contact`** class that represents a person's contact information, including their name, email address, phone number, and mailing address. This class could have properties like **`name`**, **`email`**, **`phone`**, and **`address`**, and it could provide methods for formatting the contact information in different ways, such as for a mailing label or an email signature.
- A **`ShoppingCart`** class that manages the items in a user's shopping cart. This class could have a list of **`Item`** objects, and it could provide methods for adding and removing items, calculating the total cost of the items in the cart, and checking out the cart to place an order.

These examples show how small and focused classes can be used to create simple, but powerful, software components.

### Shopping cart

Here is a simple design for a **`ShoppingCart`** class that manages the items in a user's shopping cart:

```python
class ShoppingCart:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize an empty list of items
        self.items = []

    def add_item(self, item):
        # Add an item to the shopping cart
        self.items.append(item)

    def remove_item(self, item):
        # Remove an item from the shopping cart
        self.items.remove(item)

    def get_total(self):
        # Calculate the total cost of the items in the cart
        total = 0
        for item in self.items:
            total += item.get_price()
        return total

    def checkout(self):
        # Check out the shopping cart and place the order
        print("Placing order for a total of", self.get_total())
```

### Calculator

Here is a simple design for a **`Calculator`** class that performs basic arithmetic operations:

```python
class Calculator:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the calculator with the basic operations
        self.operations = {
            "+": self.add,
            "-": self.subtract,
            "*": self.multiply,
            "/": self.divide,
        }

    def add(self, x, y):
        # Add two numbers together
        return x + y

    def subtract(self, x, y):
        # Subtract one number from another
        return x - y

    def multiply(self, x, y):
        # Multiply two numbers together
        return x * y

    def divide(self, x, y):
        # Divide one number by another
        return x / y

    def calculate(self, operation, x, y):
        # Perform a calculation using the specified operation and operands
        return self.operations[operation](x, y)

```

This **`Calculator`** class has a dictionary of operations, and it provides methods for each of the basic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The **`calculate()`** method can be used to perform a calculation using the specified operation and operands.

## Design games

Here is a simple design for a game that allows the user to play rock, paper, scissors against the computer:

```python
# The Game class represents a game of rock, paper, scissors
class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the game with the possible moves
        self.moves = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]

    def play(self):
        # Play a game of rock, paper, scissors
        while True:
            # Get the user's move
            user_move = input("Enter your move (rock, paper, scissors, or q to quit): ")
            if user_move == "q":
                break

            # Get the computer's move
            computer_move = self.moves[random.randint(0, 2)]

            # Determine the winner
            if user_move == computer_move:
                print("It's a tie!")
            elif user_move == "rock" and computer_move == "scissors":
                print("You win!")
            elif user_move == "paper" and computer_move == "rock":
                print("You win!")
            elif user_move == "scissors" and computer_move == "paper":
                print("You win!")
            else:
                print("The computer wins!")

# Create a Game object and play the game
game = Game()
game.play()
```

This **`Game`** class has a list of possible moves, and it provides a **`play()`** method that allows the user to play a game of rock, paper, scissors against the computer

## Data design

Data design is the process of designing the structure and organization of data in a database or other data storage system. This involves deciding on the data types and relationships between the data, as well as the specific implementation details of how the data will be stored and accessed.

There are several key principles and best practices that are important in data design, including the following:

- Normalization: Normalization is the process of organizing the data in a database to minimize redundancy and dependency. This can help to ensure that the data is accurate, consistent, and efficient to query.
- Entity-relationship modeling: Entity-relationship modeling is a technique for modeling the data in a database by identifying the entities (or objects) in the system and the relationships between them. This can help to create a clear and intuitive data model that accurately represents the real-world objects and relationships in the system.
- Data integrity: Data integrity refers to the accuracy and consistency of the data in a database. It is important to ensure that the data is correct, complete, and up-to-date, and that it does not contain any inconsistencies or errors.
- Security: Data security is the practice of protecting the data in a database from unauthorized access or modification. This can involve using encryption, authentication, and access controls to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the data.

Overall, data design is an important part of database development, and it is essential for creating a database that is well-organized, efficient, and secure.

### Design online store data

Here is an example of a data design for a simple online store that sells products:

```
Products:
  - ID (primary key)
  - Name
  - Description
  - Price
  - Image URL

Categories:
  - ID (primary key)
  - Name
  - Description

ProductCategories (association table):
  - ProductID (foreign key to Products)
  - CategoryID (foreign key to Categories)

Customers:
  - ID (primary key)
  - FirstName
  - LastName
  - Email
  - Phone
  - Address

Orders:
  - ID (primary key)
  - CustomerID (foreign key to Customers)
  - OrderDate
  - Total

OrderItems (association table):
  - OrderID (foreign key to Orders)
  - ProductID (foreign key to Products)
  - Quantity
```

This data design includes tables for **`Products`**, **`Categories`**, **`Customers`**, and **`Orders`**, as well as association tables for linking the **`Products`** and **`Categories`**, and the **`Orders`** and **`Products`**. This data model represents the entities and relationships in an online store, and it can be used to store and manage the data for the products, categories, customers, and orders in the system.

### Design social media app

Here is another example of a data design, this time for a social media application that allows users to post messages and follow each other:

```
Users:
  - ID (primary key)
  - FirstName
  - LastName
  - Email
  - Password
  - ProfileImageURL

Messages:
  - ID (primary key)
  - UserID (foreign key to Users)
  - MessageText
  - MessageDate

Followers (association table):
  - UserID (foreign key to Users)
  - FollowerID (foreign key to Users)
```

This data design includes tables for **`Users`** and **`Messages`**, as well as an association table for **`Followers`** that links users to the other users that they are following. This data model represents the entities and relationships in a social media application, and it can be used to store and manage the data for the users, messages, and followers in the system.

  - ID (primary key)
  - FirstName
  - LastName
  - Email
  - Password
  - Address

## API and Graph QL

API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. An API defines the interface between the different applications, and it specifies the messages that can be exchanged and the actions that can be performed.

GraphQL is a query language and runtime that is used to build and expose APIs. It provides a flexible and powerful way to query and manipulate data, and it allows the client to specify exactly the data that they need, in a single request. This can improve the performance and efficiency of the API, and it can make it easier to build and maintain the application.

Here is an example of a GraphQL query that could be used to retrieve information about a user in a social media application:

```
{
  user(id: "123") {
    id
    firstName
    lastName
    email
    profileImageUrl
    followers {
      id
      firstName
      lastName
      profileImageUrl
    }
  }
}
```

This query uses the **`user`** field to retrieve information about the user with the ID **`123`**. It also uses the **`followers`** field to retrieve information about the user's followers, including their IDs, first and last names, and profile image URLs.

This query could be executed against a GraphQL API that is built on top of a database that contains the data for the users and their followers. The API would use the query to retrieve the requested data from the database and return it to the client in the specified format.

Here is an example of a simple React app that uses GraphQL to query a user's information from a social media API:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { gql, useQuery } from "@apollo/client";

const GET_USER = gql`
  query User($id: ID!) {
    user(id: $id) {
      id
      firstName
      lastName
      email
      profileImageUrl
      followers {
        id
        firstName
        lastName
        profileImageUrl
      }
    }
  }
`;

function UserProfile(props) {
  const [userId, setUserId] = useState(props.userId);
  const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(GET_USER, {
    variables: { id: userId }
  });

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error :(</p>;

  const user = data.user;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.firstName} {user.lastName}</h1>
```

Here is an example of a simple backend server that uses GraphQL to expose an API for a social media application:

```jsx
const express = require("express");
const { ApolloServer } = require("apollo-server-express");
const { buildFederatedSchema } = require("@apollo/federation");
const { gql } = require("apollo-server");

const typeDefs = gql`
  type User @key(fields: "id") {
    id: ID!
    firstName: String
    lastName: String
    email: String
    profileImageUrl: String
  }

  type Query {
    user(id: ID!): User
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    user(_, args, context) {
      // Look up the user in the database using the provided ID
      const user = findUserById(args.id);

      // Return the user data
      return {
        __typename: "User",
        ...user
      };
    }
  }
};

const schema = buildFederatedSchema([
  {
    typeDefs,
    resolvers
  }
]);

const app = express();
const server = new ApolloServer({ schema });
server.applyMiddleware({ app });

app.listen({ port: 4001 }, () =>
  console.log(`🚀 Server ready at http://localhost:4001${server.graphqlPath}`)
);
```

This server uses the **`ApolloServer`** class from the **`apollo-server-express`** package to create a GraphQL server that exposes a single query, **`user`**, which can be used to retrieve information about a user in the system. The server defines the schema and resolvers for this query, and it uses the **`buildFederatedSchema()`** function from the **`@apollo/federation`** package to create the final schema that can be used by the server.

The server exposes the GraphQL endpoint at the **`/graphql`** path, and it listens on port 4001. The frontend application can send GraphQL queries to this endpoint to retrieve data from the server.

### Social media graph QL

Here are some more examples of GraphQL queries that could be used in a social media application:

- Retrieve a list of the user's followers:

```jsx
{
  user(id: "123") {
    id
    firstName
    lastName
    email
    profileImageUrl
    followers {
      id
      firstName
      lastName
      profileImageUrl
    }
  }
}
```

- Retrieve a list of the user's messages:

```jsx
{
  user(id: "123") {
    id
    firstName
    lastName
    messages {
      id
      messageText
      messageDate
    }
  }
}
```

- Create a new message for the user:

```jsx
mutation CreateMessage($userId: ID!, $messageText: String!) {
  createMessage(userId: $userId, messageText: $messageText) {
    id
    userId
    messageText
    messageDate
  }
}
```

- Follow another user:

```jsx
mutation FollowUser($userId: ID!, $followerId: ID!) {
  followUser(userId: $userId, followerId: $followerId) {
    user {
      id
      firstName
      lastName
    }
    follower {
      id
      firstName
      lastName
    }
  }
}
```

These queries demonstrate some of the different capabilities of GraphQL, including the ability to retrieve and manipulate data, and to combine multiple queries and mutations into a single request.

### Online store

Here is another example of a GraphQL query that could be used to retrieve information about a product in an online store:

```jsx
{
  product(id: "abc123") {
    id
    name
    description
    price
    imageUrl
    reviews {
      id
      author
      rating
      comment
    }
  }
}
```

This query uses the **`product`** field to retrieve information about the product with the ID **`abc123`**. It also uses the **`reviews`** field to retrieve the reviews for the product, including the review ID, author, rating, and comment.

This query could be executed against a GraphQL API that is built on top of a database that contains the data for the products and their reviews. The API would use the query to retrieve the requested data from the database and return it to the client in the specified format.
